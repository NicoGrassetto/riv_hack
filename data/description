High Level  This is an example of a summary document in MS XLS spreadsheet format  with the columns being the data points and the rows the metadata provided by the teams to describe the overall Sprint progress per  features listed ( rows)  per team and persona showing the nature of the feature and the actual work done progress for each feature over time in a hybrid Safe Agile / Scrum way of working.  columns L-P show data values In terms of percentage % of completion 0-100 of actual completion in per sprint ( S1 column being Sprint 1, S2 column being Sprint 2, etc. ) The idea is to present this data in graphs such as burn down charts and to then allow this data to be used for rewarding employees for their progress as a team in a gamification dashboard in real time using the data from the spreadsheet in real time as it changes.
